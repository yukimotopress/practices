# Ruby Best Practices (Manuscripts Book Edition)

by Gregory Brown

Gregory Brown is a New Haven,
Connecticut-based Rubyist who spends most of his time on free software
projects in Ruby. His main projects are Prawn and Ruport. He also is in
possession of a small bamboo plant that seems to be invincible, and he
is quite proud of this accomplishment.
